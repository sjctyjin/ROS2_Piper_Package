## Installation

### Install dependencies

```shell
pip3 install python-can
pip3 install scipy
```

```shell
pip3 install piper_sdk
```

```shell
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-ros2-control
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-ros2-controllers
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-controller-manager
```

## Quick Start

### Enable CAN module

First, you need to set up the shell script parameters.

#### Single robotic arm

##### PC with Only One USB-to-CAN Module Inserted

- **Use the `can_activate.sh`**

Directly run:

```bash
bash can_activate.sh can0 1000000
```

##### PC with Multiple USB-to-CAN Modules Inserted

**Use the `can_activate.sh`**

Disconnect all CAN modules.

Only connect the CAN module linked to the robotic arm to the PC, and then run the script.

```shell
sudo ethtool -i can0 | grep bus
```

and record the `bus-info` value, for example, `1-2:1.0`.

**Note: Generally, the first inserted CAN module defaults to `can0`. If the CAN interface is not found, use `bash find_all_can_port.sh` to check the CAN names corresponding to the USB addresses.**

Assuming the recorded `bus-info` value from the above operation is `1-2:1.0`.

Then execute the command to check if the CAN device has been successfully activated.

```bash
bash can_activate.sh can_piper 1000000 "1-2:1.0"
```

**Note: This means that the CAN device connected to the USB port with hardware encoding `1-2:1.0` is renamed to `can_piper`, set to a baud rate of 1,000,000, and activated.**

Then run`ifconfig` to check if `can_piper` appears. If it does, the CAN module has been successfully configured.

#### Enable multiple CAN modules

**Use the `can_config.sh`  here**

In the `can_config.sh`, the `EXPECTED_CAN_COUNT` shows the number of the CAN modules you want to activate. Assume it's 2 here.

Then, insert one of the two CAN modules into the PC alone and run the script.

```shell
sudo ethtool -i can0 | grep bus
```

and record the `bus-info` value, for example, `1-2:1.0`.

Next, insert the second CAN module, ensuring it is connected to a different USB port than the one used previously, and then execute the script.

```shell
sudo ethtool -i can1 | grep bus
```

**Note: Generally, the first inserted CAN module defaults to `can0`, and the second one to `can1`. If the CAN interfaces are not found, use `bash find_all_can_port.sh` to check the CAN names corresponding to the USB addresses.**

Assuming the recorded `bus-info` values are `1-2:1.0` and `1-4:1.0`, replace the parameters inside the double quotes in `USB_PORTS["1-9:1.0"]="can_left:1000000"` with `1-2:1.0`.

Similarly, update the other one

`USB_PORTS["1-5:1.0"]="can_right:1000000"` -> `USB_PORTS["1-4:1.0"]="can_right:1000000"`

**Note: This means that the CAN device connected to the USB port with hardware encoding `1-2:1.0` is renamed to `can_left`, set to a baud rate of 1,000,000, and activated.**

Then execute `bash can_config.sh` and check the terminal output to see if the activation was successful.

Afterward, run `ifconfig` to verify if `can_left` and `can_right` appear. If they do, the CAN modules have been successfully configured.

### Start the Node

```shell
colcon build
```

#### Single robotics arm

Node name: `piper_single_ctrl`

param

```shell
can_port: name of the CAN route to open.

auto_enable: Whether to automatically enable the system. If True, the system will automatically enable upon starting the program.
#  Set this to False if you want to manually control the enable state. If the program is interrupted and then restarted, the robotic arm will maintain the state it had during the last run.
# If the arm was enabled, it will remain enabled after restarting.
# If the arm was disabled, it will remain disabled after restarting.

gripper_exist: Whether there is an end gripper. If True, it means there is an end gripper and the gripper control will be turned on.

rviz_ctrl_flag: Whether to use RViz to send joint angle messages. If True, the system will receive joint angle messages sent by rViz.

gripper_val_mutiple: Set the gripper control multiplier.  

# Since the range of joint7 in RViz is [0, 0.04], while the actual gripper travel is 0.08m, the gripper needs to be set to twice the value in RViz to control the real gripper correctly.
```

There are two launch files for starting the single-arm robot: `start_single_piper_rviz.launch.py` and `start_single_piper.launch.py`.

The first one can launch RViz together, allowing you to control the robotic arm by moving the sliders.

Start the control node.

```shell
# start the node
ros2 run piper piper_single_ctrl --ros-args -p can_port:=can0 -p auto_enable:=false -p gripper_exist:=true -p gripper_val_mutiple:=2
# start the launch
ros2 launch piper start_single_piper.launch.py can_port:=can0 auto_enable:=false gripper_exist:=false gripper_val_mutiple:=2
# Or,the node can be started with default parameters
ros2 launch piper start_single_piper.launch.py
# You can also use RViz to enable control by adjusting the parameters as described above.
ros2 launch piper start_single_piper_rviz.launch.py
```

`ros2 topic list`

```shell
/arm_status #the status of arm
/enable_flag #Enable flag, sent to the node, send true to enable
/end_pose #end pose feedback
/joint_states #Subscribe to the joint message and send the joint position to this message to control the movement of the robot arm
/joint_states_single #joints feedback
/pos_cmd #end pose control
```

ros2 service list

```shell
/enable_srv #Enable service end
```

Enable robotic arm

```shell
# call service
ros2 service call /enable_srv piper_msgs/srv/Enable enable_request:\ true\ 
# pub topic
ros2 topic pub /enable_flag std_msgs/msg/Bool data:\ true\ 
```

Disable the robotic arm

```shell
# call service
ros2 service call /enable_srv piper_msgs/srv/Enable enable_request:\ false\ 
# pub topic
ros2 topic pub /enable_flag std_msgs/msg/Bool data:\ false\ 
```

Publish joint messages

Note: The robotic arm will lift. Please ensure there are no obstacles within its working range.

The robotic arm will move at 10% of the default speed, and the gripper torque is set to 0.5N.

The speed range is limited from 1 to 100. Any value less than 1 will be treated as 1.

The position is as follows:

```shell
ros2 topic pub /joint_states sensor_msgs/msg/JointState "{header: {stamp: {sec: 0, nanosec: 0}, frame_id: 'piper_single'}, name: ['joint1', 'joint2','joint3','joint4','joint5','joint6','joint7'], position: [0.2,0.2,-0.2,0.3,-0.2,0.5,0.01], velocity: [0,0,0,0,0,0,10], effort: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5]}"

```

## Note

- You need to activate the CAN device and set the correct baud rate before you can read messages from or control the robotic arm.

- If the following appears:

  ```shell
  Enable state: False
  <class 'can.exceptions.CanError'> Message NOT sent
  <class 'can.exceptions.CanError'> Message NOT sent
  ```

  This indicates that the robotic arm is not connected to the CAN module. Unplug and re-plug the USB, restart the robotic arm, reactivate the CAN module, and then try restarting the node.

- If automatic enabling is turned on and enabling is not successful within 5 seconds, the program will automatically exit.
